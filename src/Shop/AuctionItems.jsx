This piece was atmospherically fired in the gas reduction salt kiln at Medalta in Medicine Hat Alberta during a year-long artist residency from September 2024 to present. This lemon has no glaze and was made using nerikomi techniques with coloured clay. The firing process makes a glazed surface with singular results. Porcelain, stains and oxides. Reduction salt fired, cone 10. Sculptural nerikomi pieces, especially fired in the atmospheric kilns may have small cracks and imperfections that are to be embraced. ",
